# Standardly.Templates
Standardly.Templates is a .Net library designed to provide templates that .Net developers can use to generate ['The Standard'](https://github.com/hassanhabib/The-Standard) compliant code.

This library offers a structure in which new template can be added as well as a testing framework.

The structure caters for ANY coding language and my hope is that the community can come tegether on this project to help build templates that can ease / speed up repetetive tasks.
