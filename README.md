# Standardly.Core
Standardly.Templates is a .Net library designed to provide templates that .Net developers can use to generate ['The Standard'](https://github.com/hassanhabib/The-Standard) compliant code.

# How It Works
This library offers a structure in which new template can be added. It also offers a testing framework to see how the templates will be rendered based on the replacement dictionary values provided.

The templates consists of a `template.json` file that define `Tasks` with `Actions`. Tasks can be seen as everything in a Pull Request and Actions as the things that you would do in the commits that make up the Pull Request.
